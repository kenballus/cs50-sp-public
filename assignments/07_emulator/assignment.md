# Assignment 7: CHIP-8 Umulator, Due Tuesday, June 10

In this assignment, you are tasked with implementing an emulator for the CHIP-8, a fantasy video game console.

Your program should render to a window that can be X-forwarded from `plink`.
You should use the SDL2 library for graphics.

The CHIP-8 was designed in the 1970s as a simple way to write cross-platform games for obscure computers.
Instead of rewriting Pong (or whatever) for every new computer, you could instead write a game once for the CHIP-8, and it could run on any computer with a working CHIP-8 emulator.

There are many extensions to CHIP-8. Feel free to implement any that you think are cool :)

Don't worry about getting every single ROM to work; when your emulator can run some cool `.ch8` files that you get from the internet, you've done a good job.

## Helpful Resources

I'd recommend taking a look at [the CHIP-8 Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8), along with [this aggregation of resources](https://chip-8.github.io/links/).

## What to Submit

Make a `~/chip8` directory on `plink`.
Everything in this directory will be considered a part of your submission.

# Use of External Resources

Feel free to use whatever external sources you want, **so long as every keystroke in your submission is your own.**
That is to say, asking ChatGPT (or StackOverflow, or friends) for help is fine, but copy-pasting someone (or something) else's code into your submission is not.

**You are expected to thoroughly and completely understand all code that you submit.**
Your understanding will be assessed during a live, in-person interview with the course staff, which will count for a significant portion of your grade.
